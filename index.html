            <p class="para">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
            with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
    
            <p class="para">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
            made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
            evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force,
            causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
    
            <p class="para">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
            the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess.
            The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
            Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

            <p class="para">Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>
            with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
            Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
            so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched
            violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth
            of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
            Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            <p class="para">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
            to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
            It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
