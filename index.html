        <p class="para">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
            with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>

        <p class="para">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
            made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
            evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force,
            causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>

        <p class="para">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
            the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess.
            The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
            Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>

        <p class="para">Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>
            with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
            Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
            so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched
            violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth
            of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
            Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

                    <strong>THE UNIVERSE </strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky
                    Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a
                    mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>

                    <strong> NOT ENOUGH TIME </strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the
                    vast distance from one side of the universe to the other,
                    and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even

                    cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.

                    <strong>INFLATION </strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of
                    a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in
                    the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the

                    in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
                    early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

                    the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

            meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,

            Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest
